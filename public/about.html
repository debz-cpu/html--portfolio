<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Kingsley Debrah, and I completed my education at a Higher Technical Institute (HTL) with a focus on Computer Science. 
  During my studies, I gained solid theoretical knowledge in areas such as software development, networking, 
  system administration, and databases, while also working on various practical IT projects.
</p>

<p>I developed a strong interest in software quality, test automation, and modern development 
  processes—areas in which I continuously expand my skills. Through my education and additional 
  Oracle Cloud certifications, I have built a broad technical foundation that I am highly motivated to grow further.

<p>I am a structured, solution-oriented, 
  and eager-to-learn individual who enjoys taking 
  responsibility and approaching technical challenges 
  with curiosity and dedication.</p>
